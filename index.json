By increasing the share of informal but less productive workers, entrepreneurs require less working capital and can borrow more in the financial market. On the other hand, lower average labor productivity decreases output, the demand for capital, and the collateral asset price, tightening the financial constraint. Nonlinear trade-offs arise when the optimal quantity of borrowing approaches the net value of collateral.","tags":[],"title":"Collateral constraints and the informal economy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carmelo Mesa-Lago","Carla Moreno","Stephen Kay"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1638368822,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638368822,"objectID":"538f28531a1b61bd8bac615d08ff49d2","permalink":"https://Carla-Moreno.github.io/publication/cuba-issr/","publishdate":"2021-12-01T09:27:02-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cuba-issr/","section":"publication","summary":"This article analyzes Cuba’s pension system from 2006-2021 with respect to its financial and actuarial sustainability and impact on the population.

Empirical findings show that a worker's income level has a positive impact on his or her likelihood to participate. To account for these findings, a three-period overlapping generations model with liquid and illiquid assets is implemented. In the model, voluntary participation in the pension system is unattractive to individuals with income under a certain threshold. The retention of illiquid assets, such as pension funds, are not optimal given income constraints. Thus, the liquidity constraint set by a pension system with a mandatory savings policy induces these workers to choose informality","tags":["Mandatory savings, informality, liquidity constraints"],"title":"Mandatory savings, informality and liquidity constraints","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saco","M.A.C.","Seminario","B.","Leiva","F.","Moreno","C.","Zegarra","M.A."],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535760000,"objectID":"fbb07ee9aa0ecb1ee123cf996f1d99db","permalink":"https://Carla-Moreno.github.io/publication/digital-1/","publishdate":"2019-12-03T16:21:04-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/digital-1/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"La desestructuración del sistema peruano de pensiones","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saco","M.A.C.","Seminario","B.","Leiva","F.","Moreno","C.","Zegarra","M.A."],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1527811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527811200,"objectID":"5dd4dd117c8cdb312a88d4c2f9ebdd95","permalink":"https://Carla-Moreno.github.io/publication/book-1/","publishdate":"2019-12-03T16:12:41-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/book-1/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"El Porvenir de la Vejez: Demografia, Empleo y Ahorro","type":"publication"}]
