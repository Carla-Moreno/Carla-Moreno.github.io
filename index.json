Empirical findings show that a worker's income level has a positive impact on his or her likelihood to participate. To account for these findings, a three-period overlapping generations model with liquid and illiquid assets is implemented. In the model, voluntary participation in the pension system is unattractive to individuals with income under a certain threshold. The retention of illiquid assets, such as pension funds, are not optimal given income constraints. Thus, the liquidity constraint set by a pension system with a mandatory savings policy induces these workers to choose informality","tags":["Mandatory savings, informality, liquidity constraints"],"title":"Mandatory savings, informality and liquidity constraints","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saco","M.A.C.","Seminario","B.","Leiva","F.","Moreno","C.","Zegarra","M.A."],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535760000,"objectID":"fbb07ee9aa0ecb1ee123cf996f1d99db","permalink":"https://Carla-Moreno.github.io/publication/digital-1/","publishdate":"2019-12-03T16:21:04-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/digital-1/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"La desestructuraci√≥n del sistema peruano de pensiones","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saco","M.A.C.","Seminario","B.","Leiva","F.","Moreno","C.","Zegarra","M.A."],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1527811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527811200,"objectID":"5dd4dd117c8cdb312a88d4c2f9ebdd95","permalink":"https://Carla-Moreno.github.io/publication/book-1/","publishdate":"2019-12-03T16:12:41-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/book-1/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"El Porvenir de la Vejez: Demografia, Empleo y Ahorro","type":"publication"}]
